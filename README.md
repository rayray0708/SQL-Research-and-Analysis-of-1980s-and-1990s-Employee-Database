# SQL-Research-and-Analysis-Project

## Description 
In this SQL challenge, I'm tasked with doing a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. I've designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files (e.g., data modelling), imported the CSV files into a SQL database (i.e., data modelling), and then answered some questions about the data (i.e., data analysis). 
## Usage 

-To see the ER diagram, please navigate to the ERD(EmployeesSQL) file.

-To see the table schemata, please navigate to Schema(EmployeesSQL) file.

-To see query answers, please navigate to Queries(EmployeesSQL) file.

## Installations
The following dependencies were installed to run the code:
1. PosgreSQL: which can be downloaded here `https://www.postgresql.org/download/`
